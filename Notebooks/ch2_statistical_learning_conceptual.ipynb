    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">A parametric approach simplifies the problem of estimating the best fit to the training data f(x) by making some assumptions about the form of f(x), this reduces the problem to estimating the parameters of the model. A non-parametric approach make no such assumptions. Instead they seek an estimate of f that gets as close to the data points as possible without being too rough or wiggly\n",
    "\n",
    ">The advantage of the parametric approach is that it simplifies the problem of estimating f(x) because it is easier to estimate paramters than an arbitrary function. The disadvantage of this approach is that the assumed form of the function f(X) could limit the degree of accuracy with which the model can fit the training data. If too many parameters are used, in an attempt to increase the models flexibility, then overfitting can occur – meaning that the model begins to fit noise in the training data that is not representive of unseen observations. Non-parametric approaches do suffer from a major disadvantage: since they do not reduce the problem of estimating f to a small number of parameters, a very large number of observations (far more than is typically needed for a parametric approach) is required in order to obtain an accurate estimate for f."
