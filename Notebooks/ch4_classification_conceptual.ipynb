In other words, under the assumption that the observations in the kth class are drawn from a N(µk,σ2) distribution, the Bayes classiﬁer assigns an observation to the class for which the discriminant function is maximized"

    ".** This problem relates to the QDA model, in which the observations within each class are drawn from a normal distribution with a classspeciﬁc mean vector and a class speciﬁc covariance matrix. We consider the simple case where p = 1; i.e. there is only one feature. Suppose that we have K classes, and that if an observation belongs to the kth class then X comes from a one-dimensional normal distribution, X ∼ N(µk,σ2 k). Recall that the density function for the one-dimensional normal distribution is given in (4.16). Prove that in this case, the Bayes classiﬁer is not linear. Argue that it is in fact quadratic."
